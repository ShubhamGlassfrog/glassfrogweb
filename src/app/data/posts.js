Digital marketing means promoting stuff on the internet. Just like regular marketing, the idea is to let people know about your brand and what you're selling.</br></br>

Before digital marketing, businesses used non-internet ways. They put up big signs, made ads for TV and radio, put ads in newspapers, sent mail to people's homes, made phone calls, sent postcards, and made catalogues, and brochures.</br></br>

Even today, some of these old-fashioned ways still work. For example, older folks might like reading real newspapers instead of digital ones. Also, people still listen to ads on the radio. Even though digital marketing is popular, these old ways can still reach and affect a lot of people.</br></br>

In today's fast-changing digital marketing world, businesses need to keep up with the latest trends to stay competitive. Traditional methods are no longer enough. Now, success is all about creating smarter ads and achieving better results. We lead the way in this shift, providing cutting-edge services that use the latest technologies to deliver great outcomes for our clients.</br></br>

Online ads were the first to appear as the Internet became more widely available. The history of digital marketing began with this. Banner ads were among the first types of online advertising. These ads were simple yet groundbreaking and paved the way for a new marketing channel. </br></br>
